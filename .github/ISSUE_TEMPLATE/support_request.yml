        ## Before opening a support request, please check first [How to troubleshoot](https://mynamebestname.github.io/venus-os_dbus-serialbattery_docs/troubleshoot/) and the [FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)](https://mynamebestname.github.io/venus-os_dbus-serialbattery_docs/faq/) page

        In the case you have difficulties to write in english, try the [deepl.com](https://www.deepl.com) translator.

        ## üö® IMPORTANT üö®

        * Please carefully read all the instructions below including the descriptions! Very often we have to request the data again, because it was not provided in the first place.

        * Please try the `nightly` build first, if you are not already using it. It's very likely that the bug is already fixed. See [here](https://mynamebestname.github.io/venus-os_dbus-serialbattery_docs/general/install#nightly-build) how to install it.

        * Please read the complete [changelog](https://github.com/mynamebestname/dbus-serialbattery/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
